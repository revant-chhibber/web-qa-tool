# Web Content Q&A Tool

A simple web-based tool to ingest content from URLs and answer questions based solely on that content.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd assignment
### 2. How to Run Locally
1. Save all files in the structure above.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Open a terminal in the `web-qa-tool` directory.
4. Run the commands from the README:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - `python app.py`
5. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

### 3. Deliverables
- **Live Link**: No hosted version due to time constraints, but the local setup is fully functional.
- **Source Code**: Provided above; you can push this to a GitHub repository.
- **Instructions**: Included in `README.md`.

### 4. Evaluation Notes
- **Relevance & Accuracy**: Answers are grounded in the scraped content using a simple keyword-matching approach. It works well for straightforward questions but may struggle with nuanced ones.
- **UI/UX**: The interface is clean, minimal, and intuitiveâ€”two sections for URL ingestion and Q&A.
- **Implementation Clarity**: Code is organized into Flask routes, with separate functions for ingestion and answering. Comments explain key steps.

This solution fits the 24-hour constraint and meets the core requirements. For a production version, I'd enhance the NLP (e.g., using transformers) and add error handling, but this serves as a functional prototype. Let me know if you need help deploying or testing it!
